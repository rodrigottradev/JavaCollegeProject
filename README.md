# Java Project for college (Informatic Engineering in Argentina)

### Description

This project was made for POO subject in Informatic Engineering. I am sharing it in public for everyone that could use it for their own learning. I finished this in 2018, but now in 2022, since I'm learning Java again, I will refactor the code and add some new features. The project is about a simulated ATM, for now is in Spanish (I studied Informatic Engineering in Argentina) but probably I will translate it.

### Features

- MVC Implementation
- All the POO basics implemented, you will find examples of abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- Customized events and exceptions

### What I will add (just for improving my skills with Java)

- Refactor
- Asynchronous features.
- Data Base connection, since now it is all on memory.
- Improvements in interface, above all in administration panel (I built it in less than an hour because I had to deliver the project to the college... luckily I didn't broke anything :laughing:)
